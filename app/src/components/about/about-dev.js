  `    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>Gloria Anholt is a Full-Stack JavaScript developer, specializing in
        the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, NodeJS) stack. A long time Linux
        loving nerd, she also codes in Python, when possible. When not at a
        keyboard, Gloria is generally in her overgrown vegetable and herb
        garden, or building custom mason-jar shelving in her woodshop.
    </p>
    <p>To play with the code yourself, checkout
        <a href="https://github.com/GloriaAnholt/image-gallery/">my
            image-gallery repo on Github</a>.
        A full suite of tests for the server are found in server/test/,
        somewhat less comprehensive tests are available for the front end
        in app/test.
    </p>`
